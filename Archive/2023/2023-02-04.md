      * There is a problem - I added `alert` in the if which stops movement and found that the borders from the array works but something with the PacManStop is not how it would be `since 1 February`
        * We fixed it `ff et dahoum`
* Today
  * We saw how one looks in git to see what the other has done during the last several commits.
