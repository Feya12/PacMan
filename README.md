## What is special about ff

* Has done the animation w/ CSS.
  * JavaScript has more capabilities for animation thatn CSS.
  * However it is good to know both.
  * So we will leave some animation to be done w/ CSS such as the mouth animaiton movements.
    * We will need a bit of JavaScript, because when PacMan stops, the mouth stops in open state.

12:00 CET call ff et dahoum

* Review 17, 21 and 22 December `done`
* Learnings/ Mantra
  * We learned today the importance to pull before you begin work, since 17 December 2022
  * We demonstrated how one can keep a bulleted list w/ everything one does and this is the report at the end of the day, since 17 December 2022 `ff is doing it`
    * Write an article about this, since 17 December 2022 `dahoum`
  * You have committed stuff w/ conflicts, you cannot do that. If you cannot commit or push we should call `practice`
* Regression
  * The left and right movements are again diagonal (ff had tried to do something, we will examine it) `done`
* Backlog
  * Make the move animation appear smoother.
    * Make the steps smaller and configurable.
  * The PacMan leaves the labyrinth
  * Still the left and top movement are slower than the right and down `HOMEWORK`
  * TODOs
  * Heartbeat of each actor.
  * Make variables can be used in the whole code. (maybe global variables?)
