* Today
  * From some places in the right part of the labyrinth PacMan does not go left anymore `done`
    * The reason was that only one direction had the check for a crossing and the other directions did not so they allowed PacMan to leave the system of the crossins and then it did not work anymore `done`
* Mantra
